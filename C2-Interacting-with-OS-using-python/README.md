Final Project
==============

Problem Statement
-----------------

One of the servers used by your company runs a service called ticky. 
This service is an internal ticketing system used by a lot of different teams in the company to manage their work. 
The service logs a bunch of events to syslog, both when it runs successfully and when it encounters errors. 
Developers of the service are asking for your help with getting some information out of those logs, to better understand how the software is being used and how to improve it.
**So for your final project in this course, you'll write some automation scripts that will process the system log and generate a bunch of reports based on the information extracted from log files.**

Requirement
-----------

- When the service runs correctly, it logs an info message to syslog, stating what it's done, the username, and the ticket number related to the event.
- If the service encounters a problem, it logs in error message to the syslog, indicating what was wrong and the username that triggered the action that caused the problem.
- The developers of the service want two different reports out of this data. 
- The first one is a ranking of errors generated by the system. 
*This means a list of all error messages logged, and how many times each of them was found, not taking into account the users involved.* 
- They should be sorted by the most common error to the least common error.
-  The second one is a usage statistics for the service. 
*This means, a list of all users that have used the system including how many info messages and how many error messages they've generated.*
- This report should be sorted by username. 
- To visualize the data in these reports, you want to generate a couple of webpages that'll be served by a web server running on the machine. 
- Then, put the files in the directory that's used by the webserver to display the webpages. 
- The goal is to have one script that can get all the necessary work done automatically, every day without any user interaction.

Key Concepts
------------

- Approach the problem using the frameworks and best practices we’ve learned
- Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
- Create a planned approach to solve the problem
- Write a complex script which includes some of the skills we’ve learned in this course to solve this problem

Approach
--------

- Write a script to process log file and extract user information and error/info details from log file.
- Write the filtered out data to 2 csv files - user stats, error message.
- Read the 2 csv files using python script and convert the csv data to  separate html files.
